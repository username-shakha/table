## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server where you can view your React application.

## JSON Server

For simulating a backend, we use JSON Server. To start it, run:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

This will start JSON Server, serving the `db.json` file on port 3000.

## Development

During development, you can make changes to your React components and see the results in real-time thanks to hot module replacement (HMR).

## Building

To build your project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate an optimized production build of your project in the `dist` directory.
